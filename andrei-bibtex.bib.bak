  Abstract                 = {Achieving the highest level of quality for the software product being delivered is the goal of any IT organization. Every organization wants to implement processes and practices that would help achieving this goal of increasing the quality of a software product. There are so many models available today that an organization can use for developing a software but considering the dynamics of today s world where technology is changing at a fast pace and innovative products are hitting the market at great speed, these organizations do not want a software development model that consume lot of time and efforts, and hence most of the business houses are moving towards Agile approach for software development. With this change in approach for software development, the big question is that how to ensure Quality of product developed using Agile model. The traditional approach has a separate phase for testing a software product which ensures that an independent team has validated the product per specified requirements. However, with Agile way of software development, this leverage of involvement of independent test teams and test levels has taken a back. This paper, will highlight broadly the role of QA within Agile development model, with focus on fresh thoughts and approaches to improve the overall quality of product developed using Agile methodology. The use and importance of Metrics for accessing the Quality within Agile model will also be discussed.},

Traditional Quality Assurance techniques are reporting based and rely on heavy weight inspection methods whereas Agile Quality Assurance techniques are built-in daily activities by teams. Research proposal here aims to study various challenges faced in terms of assuring quality in Agile, what are the key drivers or indicators of Quality in agile and proposing the framework to evaluate what aspects of Agile improve the quality of the product in terms of bug rates, development time and costs. Through this study we aim to provide some suggestions to help organizations overcome obstacles expected in adopting the agile method as software development tool and ensuring quality.},

Further, we summarize prior research and introduce contributions in this special issue on agile software development. We conclude by discussing directions for future research and urging agile researchers to embrace a theory-based approach in their scholarship.},

In this paper we compare the waterfall model with agile processes to show how agile methods achieve software quality under time pressure and in an unstable requirements environment, i.e. we analyze agile software quality assurance. We present a detailed waterfall model showing its software quality support processes. We then show the quality practices that agile methods have integrated into their processes. This allows us to answer the question "can agile methods ensure quality even though they develop software faster and can handle unstable requirements?".},

  Abstract                 = {Managing quality during the development, operation, and maintenance of software(-intensive) systems and services is a challenging task. Although many organizations need to define, control, measure, and improve various quality aspects of their development artifacts and processes, nearly no guidance is available on how to select, adapt, define, combine, use, and evolve quality models. Catalogs of models as well as selection and tailoring processes are widely missing. A first step towards better support for selecting and adapting quality models can be seen in a classification of existing quality models, especially with respect to their suitability for different purposes and contexts. This article presents so-called comprehensive quality model landscapes (CQMLs), which provide such a classification scheme and help to get an overview of existing models and their relationships. The article focuses on the description and justification of essential concepts needed to define quality models and landscapes. In addition, the article describes typical usage scenarios, illustrates the concept with examples, and sketches open questions and future work.},
